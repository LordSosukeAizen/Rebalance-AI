# Rebalance-AI

Rebalance AI is a reinforcement learning (RL) driven portfolio management system designed to simulate and learn optimal rebalancing strategies in a stock portfolio using key technical indicators such as:

- **SMA** (Simple Moving Average)
- **EMA** (Exponential Moving Average)
- **RSI** (Relative Strength Index)
- **10-Day Average Volume**

## ðŸ§  Objective

The core goal is to **train an intelligent agent** that learns to manage and rebalance a stock portfolio over time. The agent interacts with a custom `PortfolioEnv` environment built with `OpenAI Gym` and learns optimal buy/sell/hold strategies through experience.
